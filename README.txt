Steps to execute: 

1. Specify directory of source files in line 69 of "AlgoProject.java" class.
2. In the input.txt file that is in the root directory of the project, place the data to be matched in the "input.txt" file.
3. Run the "AlgoProject.java" source file.
4. In the source directory, you will get the following text files : 

	boyerMorre.txt - Gives output for Booyer Moore Algorithm.
	kmp.txt        - Gives output for KMP string matching Algorithm.
	lcss.txt       - Gives output for LCSS Algorithm.
	naive.txt      - Gives output for Naive string matching Algorithm.

The final result is stored in the "result.txt" file.
